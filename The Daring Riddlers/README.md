Over the course of the Fall 2020 quarter at Northwestern University, our overarching theme was to look at overpolicing in Chicago geographically. To that end, we completed five individual project checkpoints that we could draw inferences and conclusions from.

These checkpoints are in their respective folders, and their topics are as follows:

## Checkpoint 1: SQL Analytics

Look at various demographics data of Chicago, preparing for future work.

Prerequisites:
* PostgreSQL (Required)

## Checkpoint 2: Data Visualizations

Visualize data regarding median income, allegation count, etc. over every district of Chicago.

Prerequisites:
* Tableau Desktop (Required)

## Checkpoint 3: Interactive Visualization

Visualize TRR concentration per district over time.

## Checkpoint 4: Machine Learning

Attempt to explain and predict the effect of various features on each district's complaint count.

Prerequisites:
* Jupyter Notebook or Lab (Required)
* NumPy 1.19.4
* MatPlotLib 3.3.2
* Scikit-Learn 0.23.2

## Checkpoint 5: Natural Language Processing

Attempt to explain and predict the effect of area and demographic features on allegation text sentiment.
