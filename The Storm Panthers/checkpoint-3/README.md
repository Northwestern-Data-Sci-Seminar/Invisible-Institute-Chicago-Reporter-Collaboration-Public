## Viz 2: Breakdown of Home Invasion Victims by Race and Gender
[See visualization here](https://observablehq.com/@fobkid20/victim-gender-race-3)
This visualization used the results of query c3_q2. It depicts the race and gender of victims of home invasion based on complaints tagged “Search Of Premise Without Warrant” in residences or private property. The visualization is togglable by race and gender.

### Observations: 
One thing immediately clear from this data is that women are more likely to report being victim of this type of interaction, regardless of race. Another is that Black individuals are overrepresented in this population, while Asian/Pacific Islanders are underrepresented. 

### Drawbacks:
There are several things not captured by this visualization. For one, the races provided in the data are mutually exclusive. However, in reality, individuals may identify as multiple races, say White and Hispanic. This is a flaw in the underlying data. Another limitation is the lack of inclusion of the demographic breakdown of Chicago, which itself contains key information necessary for understanding which home invasion populations are over or underrepresented relative to their prevalence in the community at large. This would tell us, for instance, that though Hispanics and Whites appear to be equally targeted based on the visualization, the White population is 16% larger than the Hispanic population as of the 2010 census, so the minority Hispanic population is actually overrepresented in home invasions. It would tell us more clearly the degree to which the Black population is overrepresented (70% of home invasion complaints vs. 33% of Chicago population) or the Asian/Pacific Islander population is underrepresented (0.68% of home invasion complaints vs. 5.5% of Chicago population).
