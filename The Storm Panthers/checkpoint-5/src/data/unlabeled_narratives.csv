Further, the off-duty accused member alleged that the first on-duty officer struck her on the head with a baton, placed her in a chokehold from behind, and punched her in the face. Based on corroborating witness statements, medical and physical evidence, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the off-duty accused officer bit an on-duty fellow officer, interfered with the arrest of her son, threatened the on-duty officer, grabbed the officers radio, struck a second on-duty fellow officer, and threatened the second officer. IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegation that the off-duty accused officer allowed her minor son to drive her vehicle without a license, as internal reports indicated that the son took the vehicle without the accuseds permission. The allegation that the accused off- duty officer failed to have insurance on her vehicle was NOT SUSTAINED because of contradicting statements and records. Further, IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegations that the off-duty accused officer was convicted of batter and obstruction, because these convictions were subsequently vacated by the court. Because the accuseds credibility was found to be lacking and because there was no other corroborating evidence to support the allegations that the first on-duty accused officer struck her on the head with a baton, placed her in a chokehold from behind, and punched her in the face, IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for these allegations.

The second accused member, while off-duty in the 14th District, was alleged to have failed to register a firearm that was purchased in 1998 and failed to secure her firearm. Based on statements from the first accused officer that he discharged the firearm into his left leg, that he did not comply with Department General Order 92-03-02A, which requires members to obtain qualification in order to carry auxiliary revolvers, and that he cocked the hammer of the firearm and that he fired it single action IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he was in possession of an unauthorized, unregistered firearm, and that he fired in single action. IPRA also recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member accidentally discharged the revolver based on his admissions and physical evidence of the wound to his left leg and the spent round recovered at the scene of the incident. The allegations that the accused member failed to immediately notify OEMC and failed to the 25th District desk sergeant of the firearm discharge, were NOT SUSTAINED, because he instructed the second accused member to call OEMC and report the incident on his behalf. IPRA recommended to EXONERATE the first accused member of the allegation that he left the scene of the firearm discharge, because the member explained that he was in fear for his life and did not have any protective equipment; further, the Department General Order 92-03 does not require Department members to remain at the scene of a firearm discharge when they are injured. IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation against the first accused member that he was aware that the second accused member owned an unregistered firearm and failed to report the misconduct, because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the first accused had knowledge of said misconduct. Based on the second accused members admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that she was in possession of an unregistered firearm. Lastly, IPRA found the allegation against the second accused that she failed to secure her firearm as UNFOUNDED, based on corroborating statements that the firearm was kept in a locked gun safe.

In addition, the victim further alleged that on separate occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer. There were conflicting statements between the accused and the victim, and there were no independent witnesses to corroborate either account, therefore IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member threatened to kill the victim. During the course of IPRAs investigation, no independent witnesses nor 911 calls for domestic disturbances at the accuseds apartment were found to corroborate the multiple incidents of physical domestic altercations between the victim and the accused officer. To this end, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations of the physical altercations, that the accused failed to secure his firearm during one of these altercations, and that the accused locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration. Although the victim requested police escort in order to remove her personal items from the accuseds apartment, the victim did not show up to do so and IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused did not return the victims personal items and that he destroyed her clothes and shoes, because no independent witnesses were revealed to corroborate these allegations. Because C.P.D. records substantiated that the accused member used his department user ID and password to obtain a copy of the victims criminal history, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused used his official position for personal gain/influence and that the accused associated/fraternized with a convicted felon, in that he maintained an intimate relationship with the victim after he knew her criminal history. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused officer provided a false report in that he denied having knowledge that the victim was a convicted felon and denied accessing her criminal history. Because there were no records of 911 calls reporting domestic disturbances at the subject location on the dates alleged by the victim, and because various witnesses disclosed by the victim did not cooperate with IPRAs investigation and could not corroborate the allegations that on several occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations.

"304344","On 21 March 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 23rd District, in which several Chicago Police Department officers allegedly failed to obtain medical attention for an individual within a timely manner after observing the individual place an unknown object in his mouth and complain of an inability to breathe, failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, and observed the misconduct of those officers principal to this incident and failed to report it. It is further alleged that one of the accused officers struck the individual in the face. Based on internal reports and witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations against three (3) principally involved officers that they failed to obtain medical attention for the individual in a timely manner after observing the individual place an unidentified object into his mouth and complained of difficulty breathing, and that the accused officers failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner by failing to provide said attention. In addition, IPRA recommended that an allegation against a fourth accused officer that he allegedly failed to obtain immediate medical attention for a detainee, be UNFOUNDED because witness statements established that he did not witness the individual put the object in his mouth and therefore was not aware of the need for medical attention, and also he said that he had, as a matter of course, offered medical attention and it was declined. For allegations against those officers alleged to have been witnesses to the mistreatment of the individual and to have failed to report any misconduct and failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, IPRA recommend to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations because witness statements were inconsistent and could not establish their presence when any misconduct occurred. Further, IPRA recommended a ten (10) day suspension for each of the three principally accused members."

"306446","On 24 April 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 11th District, in which two Chicago Police Department detention aides are alleged to have failed to have screened an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, and made a false entry in the inspection log. It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer."
