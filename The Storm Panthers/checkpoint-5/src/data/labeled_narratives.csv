It was alleged that an on-duty Chicago Police Department lieutenant was inattentive to duty in that she entered the wrong apartment during the execution of a search warrant and failed to ensure the proper execution of the search warrant. It was further alleged that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant was inattentive to duty in that he entered the wrong apartment during the execution of a search warrant; failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant; and failed to conduct a thorough preliminary investigation of misconduct.

Further, it was alleged against ten of the twelve accused officers that they kicked a victim; pushed the victims head into the floor; and verbally abused the victim.
