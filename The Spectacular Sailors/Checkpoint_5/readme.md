Project Title: Modeling Risk of Police Misconduct

## Summary of Checkpoint 5
In Checkpoint 4, we built a model to predict whether an officer or group of officers is a crew and therefor at higher risk of misconduct. Now, in Checkpoint 5, we explore whether language analysis of the complaint narratives can improve our predictions. For instance, what can we learn about the sentiment of complaint narratives? Is there a relationship between negative sentiments and misconduct? If so, what can we do with this knowledge?

## How to View code and analysis
The full checkpoint can be run from a Google Colab Notebook.
