Project Title: Modeling Risk of Police Misconduct

## Summary of Checkpoint 1

In Checkpoint 1 we establish a base of knowledge to characterize officers by their membership in three distinct groups. We base our initial categorization based on the results of previous topic modeling efforts that identified communities of officers and sub-communities as crews. The third community of officers are those that are neither in a crew or in a community, i.e. all other officers.


In this analysis, we define three groups as “Cohorts” where Cohort 1 are those officers in crews, Cohort 2 are those officers in communities and Cohort 3 are all other officers. Given these groupings, we investigate what the average police officer looks like in each group as compared to their counterpart in the other group. At a high-level, the questions we investigate below are (1) who are the members of each group, (2) how often are they accused or disciplined for misconduct, (3) how does each group compare to each other in terms of misconduct, and (4) what does the average officer look like in each group? The findings are outlined below; further data and details are available on GitHub. 

## How to Run queries
From /src, run cp1_crews_comm_other.sql (https://github.com/Northwestern-Data-Sci-Seminar/Invisible-Institute-Chicago-Reporter-Collaboration-Public/tree/master/The%20Spectacular%20Sailors/Checkpoint_1/src) from DataGrip while connected to the CPDB database. 

Notes are provided in the queries. In general the entire query table can be run, in sequence to produce our final CP1 output. However, we suggest stepping through the queries in each section to analyze the methodlogy and help verify our results.
