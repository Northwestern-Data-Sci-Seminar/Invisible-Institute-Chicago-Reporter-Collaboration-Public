-- Question 1: Who are the police officers according to their membership across three distinct cohorts
-- (“the Cohorts”): (1) in a crew, (2) in a community, (3) not in a crew and not in a community?
-- For instance, along the following data points:
--              Individual Police Officer Demographics
--              Counts of accusals, co-accusals, and disciplinary actions
--              Award payouts


-- Question 2: Within each Cohort, what is the average number of co-accusals per individual complaint?
-- Where the average is given by the sum of co-accusals in a Cohort divided by the total number of
-- complaints (where a complaint is a unique CRID).



-- Question 3: Within each Cohort, what percentage of allegations results in disciplinary action?
-- Where the percentage is calculated by total allegations in cohort / total times disciplined in cohort.


-- Question 4: For each Cohort, describe the average police officer in terms of demographics, accusals, and payout data.
-- By percentage:
--              Sex

--              Years on the Force: 0-9; 10-14; 15-19; 20-24; 25-29; 30+
-- By Average:
--              Payout data in thousands of dollars
