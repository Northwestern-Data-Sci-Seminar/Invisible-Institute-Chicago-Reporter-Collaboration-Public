Project Title: Modeling Risk of Police Misconduct

## Summary of Checkpoint 4
In Checkpoint 3, we build a model to predict whether an officer is in a crew, a community, or is unaffiliated, and we build a model to predict whether any particular group of officers is a crew or not based on aggregated data about their member officers.
