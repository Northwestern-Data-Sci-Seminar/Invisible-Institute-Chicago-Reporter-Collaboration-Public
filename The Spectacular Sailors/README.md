Project Title: Modeling Risk of Police Misconduct

# THEME

The theme of this project is to assess and improve upon methods to identify groups of police officers that are suspected of operating in ‘crews.’ Research into the detection of crews is significant because tight-knit groups of officers are often associated with police misconduct - the accurate detection of which may help develop interventions to prevent future misconduct. Prior efforts on crew analysis leveraged topic modeling to detect communities of police officers and then identify crews. However, given the preliminary topic modeling efforts, there is currently an opportunity to assess to what degree communities and crews are valid. Furthermore, based on a validity analysis, there is a follow-on opportunity to improve the model for either crew detection, complaint classification, or both. 

Our goal is to produce data that is useful in informing interventions that reduce police misconduct through either early detection of crew formation or modeling the risk profile of police officers that end up crossing the line from a benign community to malignant crew. For instance, are there specific attributes or features of a police officer’s career that are associated with crew membership? Or alternatively, are there specific markers of clusters in a given community that are associated with crew formation? As part of our analysis we would like to identify the most common attributes from officer complaint data that are associated with crews as one measure of validity. Lastly, and if time permits, we would like to offer suggestions on how to improve the next modeling effort to detect communities and crews. 


## Summary of Checkpoint 1 - 6 October 2020

For Checkpoint 1, we establish a base of knowledge about the status of officer communities, the communities that become crews, and information about officer complaints in these groups.  Second, we learn technical aspects of how to create and represent network graphs in SQL tables and queries. Third, and lastly, we explore how to query and join tables with address or geospatial data to identify where crews operate.
