Project Title: Network Graphs of Arresting Officers 

THEME

As provided by class, police are known to work in “crews” which are defined as "tight-knit community of officers involved in high levels of egregious misconduct and criminal activity." Four categories help define the four characteristics of a crew to include frequency, exclusivity, severity, and cohesion. A common theme among the four crew characteristics is repeated misconduct. In other words, bad cops do bad things together frequently. 
The theme of this project is to improve how crew membership is defined by analyzing complaint data and performing network analysis. At a high-level, the tasks include (1) Relational Analytics: analyze which officers are co-accused in complaints, (2) Relational Analytics: implement network analysis to confirm clusters and represent network memberships in SQL, (3) Visualization: determine whether geospatial references in complaints and beats can help identify clusters.

Summary of Checkpoint 1 - 6 October 2020

For Checkpoint 1, our team explores the dataset with SQL in three general areas. First, we craft a query that attempts to identify crew membership by combining data allegations and officers that are co-accused. Second, we learn technical aspects of how to create and represent network graphs in SQL tables and queries. Third, and lastly, we explore how to query and join tables with address or geospatial data to identify where crews operate.
