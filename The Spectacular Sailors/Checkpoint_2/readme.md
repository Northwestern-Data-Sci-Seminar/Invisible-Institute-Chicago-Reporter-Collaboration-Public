Project Title: Modeling Risk of Police Misconduct

## Summary of Checkpoint 2

In Checkpoint 2 we refine our queries from Checkpoint 1 and start to visualize the relationships among attributes of officers in three Cohorts. Cohort 1, Crews generally account for the most egregious misconduct. Cohort 2, Communities, comprise the middle third of officers - they are not quite at the level of Crews but do have some tendencies to be aware of. Cohort 3, the Unaffiliated, are the rest of all other officers with no apparent and high levels of misconduct. 


## How to View Analysis
