Yuxin Chen, Song Luo, Jing Jiang


**postgres_query.py**: By running the command 'run postgres_query.py' in terminal under the src directory, you can generate the csv file that'll be used for the Observable Notebooks. 

*This step is not necessary because files have already been attached in Notebooks. You can perform this step to check if the data source is valid*

## Question 1:

Notebook for 2006-2010: https://observablehq.com/d/8e6fa26bf1c2167f

Notebook for 2010-2014: https://observablehq.com/d/6c2172cb796fb99a

Notebook for 2014-2018: https://observablehq.com/d/1a35f874d4dc054d

Upon entering the link for each timespan, you can see the generated interactive visualization. You can already see it's clustered in different age groups. The radius of each circle is proportional to the allegation count of the officers. By clicking on each circle you can see a brief summary of officer information at the top left corner. On the top right corner there is a legend that corresponds each color to each race. 

## Question 2:

Notebook for Question 2: https://observablehq.com/@jassiay0/sunburst

This notebook is for our second question in this checkpoint. It generates a sunburst graph that intuitively shows the number of allegations and the categories of misconduct across the 3 timespans. Make sure to click the run button on the right side of the cells when you view or fork the notebook.
