Investigation Questions:
By using sentiment analysis, can we identify sentiment patterns that are different between the allegation summaries of Repeaters and Offenders?


Code-Run Instructions:

In order to run the python script, please pip install or have an anaconda environment setup with the following packages:

1. Pandas
2. NLTK
3. vaderSentiment

Also run a Python interpreter and run the following commands
>>> import nltk

Then make sure that the sentiment_analysis.py and the two excel files are in the same directory.

Run 'python3 sentiment_analysis.py' and view the sentiment analysis results in bash
