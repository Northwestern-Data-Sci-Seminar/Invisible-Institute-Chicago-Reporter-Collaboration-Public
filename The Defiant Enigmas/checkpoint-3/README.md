## Checkpoint 2
For each of the "questions" below, the link to the corresponding observable visualization for answering the question can be found in `src/V#.txt`
These files also contain the sql for populating the data files used in the visualizations.

1. (Temporal dimension) A timeline visualization of sustained allegations of most notorious officers (90th percentile) in allegations made by officers and civilians, horizontal axis displays personal trajectory while vertical axis should display lines representing multi-officer events, when vertical event lines are hovered upon, display allegation properties, such as victim info.
2. (Geographical dimension) Extends the geo symbol map in Vis-Q2, allowing users to select the percentile range using a two-sided slider.
3. (Personal and interpersonal dimension) Using data from Vis-Q3, create a force directed graph of relation between highly correlated officers (usually occurring together in the co-accused section), highlight their correlation link (while darkens other officers), and show their most common properties (either raw data clustering such as race, etc or embedded information from topic modeling, etc).
