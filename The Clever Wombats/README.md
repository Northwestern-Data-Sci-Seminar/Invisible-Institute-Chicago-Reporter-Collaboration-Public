Thank you for reading! This is our project for Data Science Seminar, in which we partnered with the Invisible Institute of Chicago. Our theme was to explore discrepencies in allegation outcomes (sustained vs not sustained). Are there differences in the result of filed allegations based on race, gender or geographical point of origin? There are 5 checkpoints starting from checkpoint 1 and ending in checkpoint 5 in numeric order. The final report is the wrap-up of the project. The readme.md in each directory dictates how to reproduce the results in our analysis for that particular checkpoint.
