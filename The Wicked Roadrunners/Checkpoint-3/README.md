## Getting Started

### Bubble Chart
To view the bubble chart visualization, open the html file "bubble_chart". We've tested this in Chrome and Edge, so use one of those browsers if you have. Each bubble represents each unit, and the size of the bubble represents the settlement costs (total over time). Hover over the bubbles for more information.

### Line chart
To view the line charts visualization, open the html file "line_chart_districts". We've tested this in Chrome and Edge, so use one of those browsers if you have. Use the select drop-down to select and view data for a police district in Chicago. The chart shows the ratio of total disciplines to total complaints over the years. This ratio is on the y-axis and time (years) is on the x-axis.
