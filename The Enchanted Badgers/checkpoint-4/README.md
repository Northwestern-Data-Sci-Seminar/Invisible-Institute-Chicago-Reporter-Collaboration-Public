# Checkpoint 4: Machine Learning

For this checkpoint, we sought to answer the following two questions.

### Question 1: We would like to model new complaint categorizations based on the raw complaint text.
To answer this question, we wrote code to perform Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA). The code and instructions for running it are included in `src/q1`.

### Question 2: We would like to determine whether a complaintâ€™s summary and category type are predictive of its final outcome.
To answer this question, we built a two different models: a bag of embeddings classifier and BERT classifier. The code and instructions for running it are included in `src/q2`.
