Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused sergeant verbally abused another victim by calling her a derogatory term in Spanish, based on corroborating witness statements. Because there was no corroborating evidence and the complainant could not provide a description of an unidentified officer, IPRA recommended a finding of NOT SUSTAINED for the allegation that on-duty unidentified Chicago Police Department Officer kneed the complainant in the thigh area. IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegation that the accused on-duty officer disobeyed a direct order by handing out the property (i.e. car keys) of a prisoner, in that the officer was not directed not to do so at that time the property was disbursed.

@@Domestic@@ On 08 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving an off-duty Chicago Police Department officer. The accused officer was alleged to have engaged in an unjustified physical altercation with a fellow department member, verbally abused the fellow member by directing profanities at her, and on separate occasions allegedly harassed her through various communications and/or followed her in his vehicle and parked outside her home, and directed profanity at her while the fellow member was on the line with a 911 dispatcher. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer engaged in an unjustified physical altercation with the fellow department member, based on physical evidence of injuries corroborating the fellow members complaint and upon the fact that the accused member was arrested for Domestic Battery and plead guilty for Disorderly Conduct relative to this alleged incident. Based on corroborating statements and 911 transmissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused verbally abused the fellow member by directing profanities at her. Because the accused member admitted to sending harassing communications and that he parked outside of the fellow members home, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN these allegations. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused provided a false report to IPRA investigators, as his statement was contradicted by multiple witness statements, about the physical altercation between he and the fellow member.

It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

Because the complaining victim recanted statements that the accused member allegedly struck her about the face and verbally abused the victim, IPRA recommended that these allegations be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended that the allegation that the accused member allegedly allowed her firearm to be released into the possession of another Department member, be UNFOUNDED, because there was insufficient evidence to substantiate any misconduct in this action. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member allegedly threatened the lives of two other individuals, because the complainants statements to outcry witnesses, corroborating statements from other witnesses, and the prompt report of the incident made to the Department resulting in the accused members subsequent arrest for simple battery. Further IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused member was intoxicated and failed to notify the Department that she was served with an Order of Protection, based on reports generated from her arrest for and criminal case for simple battery. Because there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation that the accused member falsified a report to the Office of Professional Standards about the number of firearms within her possession, IPRA recommended that this allegation be UNFOUNDED.

The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report.

Based on witness statements, physical evidence and a signed criminal complaint from the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the following allegations against the accused member: that he punched, kicked, choked, verbally abused and threw cans of beer at the complainant, attempted to prevent the complainant from contacting 911, displayed his weapon without justification, that the accused member kicked and verbally abused two fellow department members responding to calls for emergency assistance at the location of the incident, was in possession of unregistered firearms, was intoxicated and engaged in conduct bringing discredit and disrepute to the Department. Because there were no corroborating witness statements and material evidence to support the complainants allegation that the accused member physically abused her on a separate occasion, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN this allegation. Because the accused member admitted the misconduct and sought alcohol treatment on his own, IPRA recommended a sixty (60) day suspension for this accused member.	Short Term Suspension
