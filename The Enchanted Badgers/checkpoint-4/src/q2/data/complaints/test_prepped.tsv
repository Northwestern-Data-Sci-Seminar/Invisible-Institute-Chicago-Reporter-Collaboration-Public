In addition, the victim further alleged that on separate occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer. There were conflicting statements between the accused and the victim, and there were no independent witnesses to corroborate either account, therefore IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member threatened to kill the victim. During the course of IPRAs investigation, no independent witnesses nor 911 calls for domestic disturbances at the accuseds apartment were found to corroborate the multiple incidents of physical domestic altercations between the victim and the accused officer. To this end, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations of the physical altercations, that the accused failed to secure his firearm during one of these altercations, and that the accused locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration. Although the victim requested police escort in order to remove her personal items from the accuseds apartment, the victim did not show up to do so and IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused did not return the victims personal items and that he destroyed her clothes and shoes, because no independent witnesses were revealed to corroborate these allegations. Because C.P.D. records substantiated that the accused member used his department user ID and password to obtain a copy of the victims criminal history, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused used his official position for personal gain/influence and that the accused associated/fraternized with a convicted felon, in that he maintained an intimate relationship with the victim after he knew her criminal history. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused officer provided a false report in that he denied having knowledge that the victim was a convicted felon and denied accessing her criminal history. Because there were no records of 911 calls reporting domestic disturbances at the subject location on the dates alleged by the victim, and because various witnesses disclosed by the victim did not cooperate with IPRAs investigation and could not corroborate the allegations that on several occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations.
