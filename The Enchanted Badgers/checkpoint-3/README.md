# Checkpoint 3: Interactive Visualization and Data Exploration

## Important Info

For this checkpoint, we needed to perform topic modeling in order to generate a set of new categories with which we can re-categorize the existing set of complaints based on their summary text. To this end, we put together code for performing Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) to produce a set of topics based on the summary text of the complaints. Full instructions for how to run the LDA to generate the topics is included in the `findings.pdf` for this checkpoint. Note that LDA is a non-deterministic process and the same set of topics are not guaranteed to be created during successive runs.

### Question 1: Sankey diagram to visualize how uncategorized or miscategorized complaints are re-categorized by our topic modeling

*Note: This question was originally "Chord dependency diagram to visualize how uncategorized or miscategorized complaints are re-categorized by our topic modeling" in our project proposal, but was changed due to the one-sided nature of our final category to topic relationships.*
