# Checkpoint 3: Interactive Visualization and Data Exploration

## Important Info

For this checkpoint, we needed to perform topic modeling in order to generate a set of new categories with which we can recategorize the existing set of complaints based on their summary text. To this end, we put together code for performing Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) to produce a set of topics based on the summary text of the complaints. Full instructions for how to run the LDA to generate the topics is included in the `findings.pdf` for this checkpoint. Note that LDA is a non-deterministic process and the same set of topics are not guaranteed to be created during successive runs. The visualizations that follow illustrate the relationships that exist between the preexisting complaint categories and the topics generated by the LDA models.

## Interactive Visualizations

Each of the visualizations was produced on https://observablehq.com/ using D3.js. To view the visualizations for each question, simply navigate to the link provided in the following sections.

### Visualization 1: Sankey diagram to visualize how uncategorized or miscategorized complaints are recategorized by our LDA topic modeling

*Note: This question was originally "Chord dependency diagram to visualize how uncategorized or miscategorized complaints are re-categorized by our topic modeling" in our project proposal, but was changed due to the one-sided nature of our final category to topic relationships.*

**NOTE: the underlying data for visualization 1 ended up being much simpler than expected so we added an additional visualization**
