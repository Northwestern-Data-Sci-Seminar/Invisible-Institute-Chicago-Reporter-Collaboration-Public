Based on videotape footage of the incident, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer kicked one of the complainants in the chest. Because witness statements and admissions of the accused officer corroborated the allegation that the officer directed profanities at the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN this allegation. Also, based on the accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. In addition, the accused member was cited with violating Rule 6, Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral; Rule 14 for providing a false report to the Office of Professional Standards; and Rule 2, because his actions brought disrepute and/or discredit to the Department.

Because of corroborating witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused sergeant had knowledge of the allegation of misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation. Also, based on corroborating witness and complainant statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that a second accused sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants and allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station. Lastly, because witness statements contradicted the allegation that this accused sergeant directed profanities at one of the complainants, IPRA recommended that this allegation be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended separation from the Department for the accused officer, and that each of the accused sergeants receive a five (5) day suspension.
