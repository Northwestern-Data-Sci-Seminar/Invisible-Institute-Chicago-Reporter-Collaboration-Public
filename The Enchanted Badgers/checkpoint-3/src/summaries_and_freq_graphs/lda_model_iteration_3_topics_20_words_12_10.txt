Summary: On 18 April 2007, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards) regarding an incident occurring in the 14th District, in which an on-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly kicked an individual in the chest, directed profanity at him, failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. It was further alleged that an on-duty probationary police officer had knowledge of misconduct on the part of a Department member and failed to report it; that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant also had knowledge of this misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation; and that a separate on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants, allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station, and directed profanities at said individuals. Based on videotape footage of the incident, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer kicked one of the complainants in the chest. Because witness statements and admissions of the accused officer corroborated the allegation that the officer directed profanities at the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN this allegation. Also, based on the accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. In addition, the accused member was cited with violating Rule 6, Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral; Rule 14 for providing a false report to the Office of Professional Standards; and Rule 2, because his actions brought disrepute and/or discredit to the Department. The videotape footage of the incident did not support the allegation that the accused probationary police officer had knowledge of the misconduct and failed to report it, therefore IPRA recommended that this allegation be deemed UNFOUNDED. Because of corroborating witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused sergeant had knowledge of the allegation of misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation. Also, based on corroborating witness and complainant statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that a second accused sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants and allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station. Lastly, because witness statements contradicted the allegation that this accused sergeant directed profanities at one of the complainants, IPRA recommended that this allegation be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended separation from the Department for the accused officer, and that each of the accused sergeants receive a five (5) day suspension.
