On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members.

It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units.

IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

On 24 April 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 11th District, in which two Chicago Police Department detention aides are alleged to have failed to have screened an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, and made a false entry in the inspection log. It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

It was alleged that an on-duty Chicago Police Department lieutenant was inattentive to duty in that she entered the wrong apartment during the execution of a search warrant and failed to ensure the proper execution of the search warrant. It was further alleged that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant was inattentive to duty in that he entered the wrong apartment during the execution of a search warrant; failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant; and failed to conduct a thorough preliminary investigation of misconduct. It was also alleged against twelve other on-duty Chicago Police Department officers that they were inattentive to duty in that they entered the wrong apartment during the execution of a search warrant. Further, it was alleged against ten of the twelve accused officers that they kicked a victim; pushed the victims head into the floor; and verbally abused the victim. Based on department records and witness and accused statements that verified that the wrong apartment was entered in the execution of the search warrant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused lieutenant, sergeant and six other accused officers were inattentive to duty in that they entered the wrong apartment during the execution of a search warrant. Also, because there was no corroborating evidence, IPRA recommended a finding of NOT SUSTAINED for the allegation that those accused six officers who entered the wrong apartment, kicked a victim; pushed the victims head into the floor; and verbally abused the victim. Based on department records and witness and accused statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused lieutenant and sergeant failed to ensure the proper execution of the search warrant. Also, based on corroborating department records and witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused sergeant failed to conduct a thorough preliminary investigation of misconduct. For the other six of the accused officers, IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegation that these officers were inattentive to duty in that they entered the wrong apartment during the execution of a search warrant, as corroborating statements and reports indicated that these accused officers did not enter the residence. Additionally, IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegation that four of these accused officers kicked a victim; pushed the victims head into the floor; and verbally abused the victim as it was already established that these officers never entered the residence in order to engage in such acts. IPRA recommended a seven (7) day suspension for the accused lieutenant and sergeant; a three (3) day suspension for the first accused officer; and a reprimand for the other five accused officers who entered the wrong residence.

The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units.

The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit.

On 18 April 2007, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards) regarding an incident occurring in the 14th District, in which an on-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly kicked an individual in the chest, directed profanity at him, failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. It was further alleged that an on-duty probationary police officer had knowledge of misconduct on the part of a Department member and failed to report it; that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant also had knowledge of this misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation; and that a separate on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants, allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station, and directed profanities at said individuals. Based on videotape footage of the incident, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer kicked one of the complainants in the chest. Because witness statements and admissions of the accused officer corroborated the allegation that the officer directed profanities at the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN this allegation. Also, based on the accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. In addition, the accused member was cited with violating Rule 6, Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral; Rule 14 for providing a false report to the Office of Professional Standards; and Rule 2, because his actions brought disrepute and/or discredit to the Department. The videotape footage of the incident did not support the allegation that the accused probationary police officer had knowledge of the misconduct and failed to report it, therefore IPRA recommended that this allegation be deemed UNFOUNDED. Because of corroborating witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused sergeant had knowledge of the allegation of misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation. Also, based on corroborating witness and complainant statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that a second accused sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants and allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station. Lastly, because witness statements contradicted the allegation that this accused sergeant directed profanities at one of the complainants, IPRA recommended that this allegation be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended separation from the Department for the accused officer, and that each of the accused sergeants receive a five (5) day suspension.	Use Of Force

On 18 April 2007, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards) regarding an incident occurring in the 14th District, in which an on-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly kicked an individual in the chest, directed profanity at him, failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. It was further alleged that an on-duty probationary police officer had knowledge of misconduct on the part of a Department member and failed to report it; that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant also had knowledge of this misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation; and that a separate on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants, allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station, and directed profanities at said individuals. Based on videotape footage of the incident, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer kicked one of the complainants in the chest. Because witness statements and admissions of the accused officer corroborated the allegation that the officer directed profanities at the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN this allegation. Also, based on the accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. In addition, the accused member was cited with violating Rule 6, Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral; Rule 14 for providing a false report to the Office of Professional Standards; and Rule 2, because his actions brought disrepute and/or discredit to the Department. The videotape footage of the incident did not support the allegation that the accused probationary police officer had knowledge of the misconduct and failed to report it, therefore IPRA recommended that this allegation be deemed UNFOUNDED. Because of corroborating witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused sergeant had knowledge of the allegation of misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation. Also, based on corroborating witness and complainant statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that a second accused sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants and allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station. Lastly, because witness statements contradicted the allegation that this accused sergeant directed profanities at one of the complainants, IPRA recommended that this allegation be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended separation from the Department for the accused officer, and that each of the accused sergeants receive a five (5) day suspension.	Use Of Force

On January 31, 2016, around 4:30 P.M., Officer A responded to a call of a battery in progress at South Independence. According to the 911 caller, an African American male, wearing a tan jacket, was hitting an African American female dressed in black. Upon arrival to the scene, responding officers observed complainant Subject 1, an African American male, escorting Civilian 1, an African American female. Subject 1, who was dressed in a tan jacket, appeared to be forcing his darkly?dressed companion to walk along. Considering 1) that Subject 1 and Civilian matched the description provided by the 911 caller; 2) that Subject 1 and Civilian were in the location provided by the 911 caller; and, 3) Subject 1?s unusual actions with Civilian 1, Officer A decided to investigate the situation. When Officer A inquired if Subject 1 and Civilian were okay, Subject 1 stated that they were fine, but would not allow Civilian to respond. Subject 1 then began to move away from the responding officers, apparently hiding something in his pocket, while using Civilian to shield his actions. Given the nature of the 911 call that brought Officer A to the scene, Officer A became concerned for the safety of Civilian 1. At this point, Subject 1 was handcuffed and separated from Civilian 1. Once away from Subject 1, Civilian 1 stated that Subject 1 had been physical with her, but that she was unwilling to press charges. Civilian 1 also stated that she had been taking PCP with Subject 1, prompting Officer A to call for an ambulance. When asked, Subject 1 also admitted to getting high on PCP with Civilian 1. After running a name check on Subject 1, Officer A released Subject 1, providing Subject 1 with an investigatory stop receipt. Later in the evening, Subject 1 traveled to Hospital A, complaining that his wrists hurt. A Chicago Police Sergeant and Evidence Technician visited Subject 1 at the hospital, where photos were taken of Subject 1. These photos show very light marking on Subject 1?s wrists. On February 3, 2016, Subject 1 came in to IPRA to report his involvement in the incident. The following investigation was commenced based on his allegations.	Use Of Force

On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members. It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

On 24 April 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 11th District, in which two Chicago Police Department detention aides are alleged to have failed to have screened an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, and made a false entry in the inspection log. It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.
