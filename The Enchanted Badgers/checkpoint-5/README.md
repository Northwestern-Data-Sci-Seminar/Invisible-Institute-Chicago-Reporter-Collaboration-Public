# Checkpoint 5: Natural Language Processing

For this checkpoint, we sought to answer the following question.

### Question 1: Train a transformer language model (e.g. BERT) by using a dataset of complaints with assigned categories (the input being the report narrative, and the label being the category). Use this trained model to predict the categories of complaints which are currently not categorized, or categorized as “other”.

To answer this question, we built a two different models: a bag of embeddings classifier and BERT classifier. The code and instructions for running it are included in `src/complaint_classification`.
