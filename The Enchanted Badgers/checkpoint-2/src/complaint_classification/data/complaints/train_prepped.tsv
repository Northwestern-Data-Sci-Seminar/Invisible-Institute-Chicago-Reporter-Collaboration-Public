On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members. It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

Further, the off-duty accused member alleged that the first on-duty officer struck her on the head with a baton, placed her in a chokehold from behind, and punched her in the face.

IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegation that the off-duty accused officer allowed her minor son to drive her vehicle without a license, as internal reports indicated that the son took the vehicle without the accuseds permission. The allegation that the accused off- duty officer failed to have insurance on her vehicle was NOT SUSTAINED because of contradicting statements and records. Further, IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegations that the off-duty accused officer was convicted of batter and obstruction, because these convictions were subsequently vacated by the court. Because the accuseds credibility was found to be lacking and because there was no other corroborating evidence to support the allegations that the first on-duty accused officer struck her on the head with a baton, placed her in a chokehold from behind, and punched her in the face, IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for these allegations.

On 24 April 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 11th District, in which two Chicago Police Department detention aides are alleged to have failed to have screened an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, and made a false entry in the inspection log. It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

On 03 July 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding various incidents occurring in the 2nd District, in which an off-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly threatened to kill the victim during a telephone argument, engaged in physical domestic altercations with the victim at various times, failed to properly secure his firearm during one of these domestic altercations, locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration, did not return the victims personal items after she moved out of the domicile, destroyed her clothes and shoes, used his official position for personal gain/influence in that he obtained the victims criminal history, and associated/fraternized with a convicted felon. In addition, the victim further alleged that on separate occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer. There were conflicting statements between the accused and the victim, and there were no independent witnesses to corroborate either account, therefore IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member threatened to kill the victim. During the course of IPRAs investigation, no independent witnesses nor 911 calls for domestic disturbances at the accuseds apartment were found to corroborate the multiple incidents of physical domestic altercations between the victim and the accused officer. To this end, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations of the physical altercations, that the accused failed to secure his firearm during one of these altercations, and that the accused locked the victims children out of the accuseds apartment during the victims incarceration. Although the victim requested police escort in order to remove her personal items from the accuseds apartment, the victim did not show up to do so and IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused did not return the victims personal items and that he destroyed her clothes and shoes, because no independent witnesses were revealed to corroborate these allegations. Because C.P.D. records substantiated that the accused member used his department user ID and password to obtain a copy of the victims criminal history, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused used his official position for personal gain/influence and that the accused associated/fraternized with a convicted felon, in that he maintained an intimate relationship with the victim after he knew her criminal history. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused officer provided a false report in that he denied having knowledge that the victim was a convicted felon and denied accessing her criminal history. Because there were no records of 911 calls reporting domestic disturbances at the subject location on the dates alleged by the victim, and because various witnesses disclosed by the victim did not cooperate with IPRAs investigation and could not corroborate the allegations that on several occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations. IPRA recommended separation for the accused officer.	Domestic

On 24 February 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 6th District, involving a then unknown Chicago Police Department officer, who allegedly abused a complainant. This initial investigation was closed because IPRA was not able to obtain a sworn and signed affidavit from the complainant. Upon administrative review, the investigation was re-opened on 11 December 2006. Based on subsequent investigation, IPRA identified separate misconduct and it was alleged that the first accused officer submitted a false Department report and signed another officers name to a Department report without permission. The second accused officer was alleged to have submitted a false Department report, signed another officers name to a Department report without permission, and was aware the misconduct of the first accused officer and failed to report it. Based on the corroborating witness statements from a fellow Department member and on the first accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused officer submitted a false Department report and signed another officers name to a Department report. Again, based on corroborating witness statements from the fellow Department member and the first accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the second accused officer submitted a false Department report. In turn based on said statements and admissions, IPRA found the allegation that the second accused officer signed another officers name to a Department report as UNFOUNDED. Lastly, based on the second accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that he was aware of the misconduct by the first accused officer and failed to report it.

It was also alleged that two on-duty Chicago Police Department officers gave a false statement to IPRA regarding the circumstances involving the arrest of the subject. Based on the statements of the subject and corroborating witnesses and/or photographic evidence of the injuries, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused sergeant slammed the subjects head against a squad car while the subject was handcuffed; grabbed the subject by his face while he was handcuffed; grabbed the subject by the throat while he was handcuffed; struck the subject on his head while he was handcuffed; and pulled on the back of the subjects pants causing the subjects clothing to squeeze his testicles, while he was handcuffed. Because witness statements only corroborated part of the allegation that the accused sergeant threw the subjects keys toward the sewer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN only this portion of the allegation. Further, based on the statements of the subject and corroborating witnesses, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused sergeant called the subject a racial slur; threatened to kill the subject and instructed two subordinate officers to run a name check on the subject and to release the subject if the check returned negative results, which is a violation of Department rules. Based on the accused sergeants admissions, witness statements, and Department reports, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused sergeant gave a false report to his commanding officer about the extent of his physical contact with the subject; that he submitted a false Department report by excluding the physical contact/force that he used on the subject; and that at a separate time, he gave a false statement to IPRA regarding the circumstances involving the arrest of the subject. IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegations that the two other accused officers gave a false statement to IPRA regarding the circumstances involving the arrest of the subject, because there was no evidence to support this allegation.

On 01 November 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding incidents occurring in the 25th and 14th Districts, involving two off-duty Chicago Police Department members. The first accused member, while off-duty in the 25th District was alleged to have been in possession of an unauthorized firearm, that he fired that revolver in single action, accidentally discharging the firearm, and failed to immediately notify the Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC) and the desk sergeant of the 25th District of the firearm discharge, left the scene of the firearm discharge, and had knowledge of and failed to report the misconduct of a second accused member. The second accused member, while off-duty in the 14th District, was alleged to have failed to register a firearm that was purchased in 1998 and failed to secure her firearm. Based on statements from the first accused officer that he discharged the firearm into his left leg, that he did not comply with Department General Order 92-03-02A, which requires members to obtain qualification in order to carry auxiliary revolvers, and that he cocked the hammer of the firearm and that he fired it single action IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he was in possession of an unauthorized, unregistered firearm, and that he fired in single action. IPRA also recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member accidentally discharged the revolver based on his admissions and physical evidence of the wound to his left leg and the spent round recovered at the scene of the incident. The allegations that the accused member failed to immediately notify OEMC and failed to the 25th District desk sergeant of the firearm discharge, were NOT SUSTAINED, because he instructed the second accused member to call OEMC and report the incident on his behalf. IPRA recommended to EXONERATE the first accused member of the allegation that he left the scene of the firearm discharge, because the member explained that he was in fear for his life and did not have any protective equipment; further, the Department General Order 92-03 does not require Department members to remain at the scene of a firearm discharge when they are injured. IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation against the first accused member that he was aware that the second accused member owned an unregistered firearm and failed to report the misconduct, because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the first accused had knowledge of said misconduct. Based on the second accused members admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that she was in possession of an unregistered firearm. Lastly, IPRA found the allegation against the second accused that she failed to secure her firearm as UNFOUNDED, based on corroborating statements that the firearm was kept in a locked gun safe. IPRA recommended a ten (10) day suspension for the first accused member and a five (5) day suspension for the second accused member.	Use Of Force

The second accused Chicago Police Department officer allegedly witnessed the misconduct and failed to report it. Based on videotape evidence, admissions by the first accused member, and witness testimony, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the following allegations against said accused: that the accused beat the individual about the head; grabbed the individual by the neck; physically mistreated the individual; that the accused attempted to obtain and destroy videotape footage; that the accused was charged with several criminal violations; and that the accused pled guilty to misdemeanor battery and was subsequently found guilty.

On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members. It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

On 24 April 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 11th District, in which two Chicago Police Department detention aides are alleged to have failed to have screened an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, and made a false entry in the inspection log. It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members. It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

On 18 April 2007, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards) regarding an incident occurring in the 14th District, in which an on-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly kicked an individual in the chest, directed profanity at him, failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. It was further alleged that an on-duty probationary police officer had knowledge of misconduct on the part of a Department member and failed to report it; that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant also had knowledge of this misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation; and that a separate on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants, allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station, and directed profanities at said individuals. Based on videotape footage of the incident, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer kicked one of the complainants in the chest. Because witness statements and admissions of the accused officer corroborated the allegation that the officer directed profanities at the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN this allegation. Also, based on the accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. In addition, the accused member was cited with violating Rule 6, Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral; Rule 14 for providing a false report to the Office of Professional Standards; and Rule 2, because his actions brought disrepute and/or discredit to the Department. The videotape footage of the incident did not support the allegation that the accused probationary police officer had knowledge of the misconduct and failed to report it, therefore IPRA recommended that this allegation be deemed UNFOUNDED. Because of corroborating witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused sergeant had knowledge of the allegation of misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation. Also, based on corroborating witness and complainant statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that a second accused sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants and allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station. Lastly, because witness statements contradicted the allegation that this accused sergeant directed profanities at one of the complainants, IPRA recommended that this allegation be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended separation from the Department for the accused officer, and that each of the accused sergeants receive a five (5) day suspension.	Use Of Force

On 18 April 2007, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards) regarding an incident occurring in the 14th District, in which an on-duty Chicago Police Department officer allegedly kicked an individual in the chest, directed profanity at him, failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. It was further alleged that an on-duty probationary police officer had knowledge of misconduct on the part of a Department member and failed to report it; that an on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant also had knowledge of this misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation; and that a separate on-duty Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants, allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station, and directed profanities at said individuals. Based on videotape footage of the incident, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused officer kicked one of the complainants in the chest. Because witness statements and admissions of the accused officer corroborated the allegation that the officer directed profanities at the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN this allegation. Also, based on the accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that he failed to complete a Field Contact Card and a Tactical Response Report. In addition, the accused member was cited with violating Rule 6, Disobedience of an order or directive, whether written or oral; Rule 14 for providing a false report to the Office of Professional Standards; and Rule 2, because his actions brought disrepute and/or discredit to the Department. The videotape footage of the incident did not support the allegation that the accused probationary police officer had knowledge of the misconduct and failed to report it, therefore IPRA recommended that this allegation be deemed UNFOUNDED. Because of corroborating witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused sergeant had knowledge of the allegation of misconduct and failed to conduct a complete and thorough investigation. Also, based on corroborating witness and complainant statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that a second accused sergeant failed to initiate a complaint on behalf of two complainants and allowed two officers to escort one of the complainants out of the station. Lastly, because witness statements contradicted the allegation that this accused sergeant directed profanities at one of the complainants, IPRA recommended that this allegation be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended separation from the Department for the accused officer, and that each of the accused sergeants receive a five (5) day suspension.	Use Of Force

It is further alleged that one of the accused officers struck the individual in the face. Based on internal reports and witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations against three (3) principally involved officers that they failed to obtain medical attention for the individual in a timely manner after observing the individual place an unidentified object into his mouth and complained of difficulty breathing, and that the accused officers failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner by failing to provide said attention. In addition, IPRA recommended that an allegation against a fourth accused officer that he allegedly failed to obtain immediate medical attention for a detainee, be UNFOUNDED because witness statements established that he did not witness the individual put the object in his mouth and therefore was not aware of the need for medical attention, and also he said that he had, as a matter of course, offered medical attention and it was declined. For allegations against those officers alleged to have been witnesses to the mistreatment of the individual and to have failed to report any misconduct and failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, IPRA recommend to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations because witness statements were inconsistent and could not establish their presence when any misconduct occurred.

On 21 March 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 23rd District, in which several Chicago Police Department officers allegedly failed to obtain medical attention for an individual within a timely manner after observing the individual place an unknown object in his mouth and complain of an inability to breathe, failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, and observed the misconduct of those officers principal to this incident and failed to report it. It is further alleged that one of the accused officers struck the individual in the face. Based on internal reports and witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations against three (3) principally involved officers that they failed to obtain medical attention for the individual in a timely manner after observing the individual place an unidentified object into his mouth and complained of difficulty breathing, and that the accused officers failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner by failing to provide said attention. In addition, IPRA recommended that an allegation against a fourth accused officer that he allegedly failed to obtain immediate medical attention for a detainee, be UNFOUNDED because witness statements established that he did not witness the individual put the object in his mouth and therefore was not aware of the need for medical attention, and also he said that he had, as a matter of course, offered medical attention and it was declined. For allegations against those officers alleged to have been witnesses to the mistreatment of the individual and to have failed to report any misconduct and failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, IPRA recommend to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations because witness statements were inconsistent and could not establish their presence when any misconduct occurred. Further, IPRA recommended a ten (10) day suspension for each of the three principally accused members.	Use Of Force

The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.
