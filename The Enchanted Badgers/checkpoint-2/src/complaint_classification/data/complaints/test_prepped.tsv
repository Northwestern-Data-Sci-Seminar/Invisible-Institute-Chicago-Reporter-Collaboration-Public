On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members. It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

Based on witness statements, physical evidence and a signed criminal complaint from the complainant, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the following allegations against the accused member: that he punched, kicked, choked, verbally abused and threw cans of beer at the complainant, attempted to prevent the complainant from contacting 911, displayed his weapon without justification, that the accused member kicked and verbally abused two fellow department members responding to calls for emergency assistance at the location of the incident, was in possession of unregistered firearms, was intoxicated and engaged in conduct bringing discredit and disrepute to the Department. Because there were no corroborating witness statements and material evidence to support the complainants allegation that the accused member physically abused her on a separate occasion, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN this allegation. Because the accused member admitted the misconduct and sought alcohol treatment on his own, IPRA recommended a sixty (60) day suspension for this accused member.	Domestic

On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members. It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

On 24 April 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 11th District, in which two Chicago Police Department detention aides are alleged to have failed to have screened an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, and made a false entry in the inspection log. It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

On 28 December 2006, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 4th District, involving fourteen (14) on-duty Chicago Police Department members. It was generally alleged against all of the members that they entered a first floor front apartment without justification and a first floor rear apartment without justification. It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

It was further alleged against the accused lieutenant that he failed to ensure the proper execution of a search warrant. Against the accused sergeant, it was alleged that he failed to ensure proper execution of a search warrant and that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report submitted to IPRA. Lastly, against one of the principally accused officers, it was alleged that he kicked an occupant of one of the residences in his ribs. Nine of the accused members were EXONERATED of the first general allegation that the members entered the first floor front residence without justification, based on the determination that it was entered during the execution of a valid search warrant. The accused lieutenant was EXONERATED of the second allegation that he entered the first floor front apartment without justification, because exigent circumstances justified his entry. The allegation against the accused lieutenant and accused sergeant that they failed to ensure proper execution of the search warrant was SUSTAINED because although the lieutenant issued an order for the accused members to breach the first floor unit to the left of the entryway, members under his command breached both first floor units. The second general allegation against the accused sergeant and one of the accused officers, that they entered the first floor rear apartment improperly was NOT SUSTAINED because although they were identified by the complainant, no other evidence could support the allegation that they entered the first floor rear apartment without justification. IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation against the accused sergeant that he failed to include pertinent information in his initiation report, because it was revealed that he and officers from his unit were involved in the breach of the first floor rear unit and detained the complainant, who was not the subject of the search warrant; the sergeant failed to include this information in his initiation report. The allegations against one of the accused officers that he entered the first floor rear apartment and that he kicked that apartments occupant, was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he was breached this unit and had contact with the complainant and corroborating witness statements and the physical injuries on the complainant. The allegation that a third accused member entered the first floor rear unit without justification was SUSTAINED based on the officers admissions that he entered the unit. For the remaining accused officers, IPRA recommended that the general allegations that they entered the first floor front unit without justification and the first floor rear unit without justification, be UNFOUNDED, as there was no evidence that these officers entered either unit. IPRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused sergeant and the principally accused officer; a ten (10) day suspension for the accused lieutenant; and a four (4) day suspension for the other accused officer.

On 24 April 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 11th District, in which two Chicago Police Department detention aides are alleged to have failed to have screened an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, and made a false entry in the inspection log. It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer.

On 21 March 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, formerly known as the Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident that occurred in the 23rd District, in which several Chicago Police Department officers allegedly failed to obtain medical attention for an individual within a timely manner after observing the individual place an unknown object in his mouth and complain of an inability to breathe, failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, and observed the misconduct of those officers principal to this incident and failed to report it. It is further alleged that one of the accused officers struck the individual in the face. Based on internal reports and witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations against three (3) principally involved officers that they failed to obtain medical attention for the individual in a timely manner after observing the individual place an unidentified object into his mouth and complained of difficulty breathing, and that the accused officers failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner by failing to provide said attention. In addition, IPRA recommended that an allegation against a fourth accused officer that he allegedly failed to obtain immediate medical attention for a detainee, be UNFOUNDED because witness statements established that he did not witness the individual put the object in his mouth and therefore was not aware of the need for medical attention, and also he said that he had, as a matter of course, offered medical attention and it was declined. For allegations against those officers alleged to have been witnesses to the mistreatment of the individual and to have failed to report any misconduct and failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, IPRA recommend to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations because witness statements were inconsistent and could not establish their presence when any misconduct occurred. Further, IPRA recommended a ten (10) day suspension for each of the three principally accused members.	Use Of Force
