## Theme

This project aims to learn about what role the race plays throughout the Chicago Police
Department. The project aims to learn whether being part of a particular race gives you any bias when it comes to different facets of a case like, monetary compensation, allegations sustained, common misconducts, etc. We would analyse the database provided to us and identify the relationship between how the race of the individuals involved affects the verdict of the case. We’ll also be analyzing how the race of the investigating officer may impact the turnout of the case, whether allegations are more likely to be sustained if the perpetrator is of a particular racial identity. This can also be extended to areas of segregated localities to analyse whether over policing occurs.  Is there a correlation between the officers’ salary and the race?


## Project Structure

These are the questions we wanted to answer with this project. This project was developed for Jennie Roger's Fall 2020 Data Science Seminar course. The project has the following structure and is divided into five checkpoints.
* [**Checkpoint 1**: Relational Analytics](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_1/) 
* [**Checkpoint 2**: Data Visualizations](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_2/)
* [**Checkpoint 3**: Interactive Data Visualizations](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_3/)
* [**Checkpoint 4**: Machine Learning](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_4/)
* [**Checkpoint 5**: Natural Language Processing](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_5/)

You can find the material related to each of the checkpoints in the respective checkpoint folder.
