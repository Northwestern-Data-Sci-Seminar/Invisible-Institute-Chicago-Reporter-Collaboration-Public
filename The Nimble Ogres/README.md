# Theme

This project aims to learn about what role the race plays throughout the Chicago Police
Department. The project aims to learn whether being part of a particular race gives you any bias when it comes to different facets of a case like, monetary compensation, allegations sustained, common misconducts, etc. We would analyse the database provided to us and identify the relationship between how the race of the individuals involved affects the verdict of the case. We’ll also be analyzing how the race of the investigating officer may impact the turnout of the case, whether allegations are more likely to be sustained if the perpetrator is of a particular racial identity. This can also be extended to areas of segregated localities to analyse whether over policing occurs.  Is there a correlation between the officers’ salary and the race?

# Project Structure

These are the questions we wanted to answer with this project. This project was developed for Jennie Roger's Fall 2020 Data Science Seminar course. The project has the following structure and is divided into five checkpoints.
* [**Checkpoint 1**: Relational Analytics](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_1/) 
* [**Checkpoint 2**: Data Visualizations](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_2/)
* [**Checkpoint 3**: Interactive Data Visualizations](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_3/)
* [**Checkpoint 4**: Machine Learning](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_4/)
* [**Checkpoint 5**: Natural Language Processing](/The%20Nimble%20Ogres/Checkpoint_5/)

You can find the material related to each of the checkpoints in the respective checkpoint folder.

Each Checkpoint majorly has 3 points of interest:
*	src folder: Contains the code related to that specific checkpoint
*	findings.pdf: Contains the summarized findings and our inferences to the results we found during our data analysis.
* README: These are specific to each checkpoints and contains information on how to run the particular checkpoint.


**Questions we explored for each checkpoint.  The findings for these are reported at the time of running and may not be updated with the current state of the database. Queries given can be re-run as long as the database schema remains consistent**

## Checkpoint - 1 : Relational Analytics

* What is the average value of settlement payout money based on your race.
* What were the misconducts that won the settlements? Which were the most common misconducts?
* With respect to allegations, does a particular combination of police and victim race have a larger chance of being sustained?
* Does the race of police officer investigating an allegation and the race of the involved police officer play a role in whether the allegation is sustained? 


## Checkpoint - 2 : Data Visualization

* Is there any relationship between the type of misconduct and the race of the officer?
* How have the number of allegations filed by a race changed over the years?

## Checkpoint - 3 : Interactive Data Visualization

* Is there any pattern between the race of the victim, and where the allegation was reported?
* How does the number of officers relate to the population of different areas of Chicago over the years?

## Checkpoint - 4 : Machine Learning

* To Classify each officer in a group based on the number of allegations that an officer might be involved in.
* To detect the ambiguity in the salaries of the officers.


## Checkpoint - 5 : Natural Language Processing

* To build an NLP Pipeline which will read through the filed reports and use it as a feature for predictive modelling. This can give the victim a good estimation of whether or not the allegation will sustain.
