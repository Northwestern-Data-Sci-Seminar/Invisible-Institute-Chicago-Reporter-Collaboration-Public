### Does being a part of a particular race, both as the victim or as the perpetrator, change how your allegation is handled? Is there a correlation between the officersâ€™ salary and the race? Between the average settlement rates? Is there more policing, more allegations in certain neighborhoods?

These are the questions we wanted to answer with this project. This project was developed for Jennie Roger's Fall 2020 Data Science Seminar course. The project has the following structure and is divided into five checkpoints.
* **Checkpoint 1**: Relational Analytics
* **Checkpoint 2**: Data Visualizations
* **Checkpoint 3**: Interactive Data Visualizations
* **Checkpoint 4**: Machine Learning
* **Checkpoint 5**: Natural Language Processing

You can find the material related to each of the checkpoints in the respective checkpoint folder.
