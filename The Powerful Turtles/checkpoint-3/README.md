# **Checkpoint 3**

*Team member: Jiangnan Fu, Yunan Wu, Ziyin Huang*

**Theme**

In this project, we would like to study how the demographics comparison between the complainants and the respective police officers reported correlating to the number of complaints. In this checkpoint, we perform interactive data visualization of race matching correlation between officers and complainants relative to the community race distribution. The results reveal uneven race distribution of officers compared to their corresponding community, and the race difference between officer and complainant in their corresponding community may contribute to higher numbers of complaints. The results from this checkpoint provide us some insights for selecting parameters for the machine learning checkpoint.

**Relational Analytics Questions:**

1. Stacked-to-Grouped Bars showing the relationship between officer race and the community population race. 

2. A scatter plot matrix showing the relationship between officer race percentage within community vs. complaint filer race percentage within the community.
