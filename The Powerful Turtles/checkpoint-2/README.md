# **Checkpoint 2**

*Team member: Jiangnan Fu, Yunan Wu, Ziyin Huang*

**Theme**

In this project, we would like to study how the demographics comparison between the complainants and the respective police officers reported correlating to the number of complaints. In this checkpoint, we perform data visualization of race distributions among the officers and the complainants using Tableau. The results from this checkpoint provide the foundation for the interactive data visualization tasks in the next checkpoint, where the cross-correlation between the officer race and complainant race with respect to the community race composition. Together, these visualizations will provide guidance for future checkpoints.


**Relational Visualization Questions:**

1. A pie chart showing the race distribution among the officers and the allegation counts within each race distribution.


2. A bar chart showing the race distribution among the complainant
