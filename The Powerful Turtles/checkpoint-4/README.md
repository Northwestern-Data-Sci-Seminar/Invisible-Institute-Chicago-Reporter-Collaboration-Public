# **Checkpoint 3**

*Team member: Jiangnan Fu, Yunan Wu, Ziyin Huang*

**Theme**

In this project, we would like to study how the demographics comparison between the complainants and the respective police officers reported correlating to the number of complaints. In this checkpoint, we break down the analysis from two different perspectives. The first part is to predict the number of complaints about each police officer based on the available police information. In the second part, we analyze the correlation between police demographics and complaint demographics to predict how such a correlation affects whether complaints take place.

**Relational Analytics Questions:**

1. Regression analysis to predict the number of complaints based on police information.

2. Predict the demographic difference interval between the officer and the complainant with the community that the two groups can live with each other with minimal complaints.
