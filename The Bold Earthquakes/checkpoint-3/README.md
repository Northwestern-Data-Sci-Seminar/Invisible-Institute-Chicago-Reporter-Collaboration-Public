# Checkpoint 3: Interactive Visualization

Our group produced an interactive histogram visualization. This visualization shows salaries and allegations for Police Officers during the period 2007-2015, inclusive. The histogram can be filtered by confounding factors like race, gender, and number of allegations obtained during that period, and number of sustained allegations obtained during that period.

Here and in the `findings` report, we link to the D3 Visualization notebook, where you can see the visualization and the code. We also identify the sql file containing the SQL queries used to get the data and the csv file containing the data.  

`src` contains the SQL scripts to obtain the csv data for each question. 
`data` contains the csv data. 
`images` contains the .png files of the visualizations.
