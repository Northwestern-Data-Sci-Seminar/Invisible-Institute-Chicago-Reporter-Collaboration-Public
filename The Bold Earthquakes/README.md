 For the CPD to function as intended, the incentive system needs to be aligned with the public interest. Given the CPD record of misconduct, the existence of phenomena such as the “blue wall of silence”, and the appearance of impunity for misconduct within the force, we expect to see that police officer rewards, as defined below, are not aligned with the fulfillment of their roles.

 We will analyze instances of career rewards and misconduct records, and the relationships between rewards and misconduct. We understand that police officers get yearly pay raises, so better indicators of reward are pay raise % for the same rank, promotions, and awards. We understand that many factors go into career advancement: successes, failures, misconduct, race, gender, unit, visibility of one's work, network, etc. However, we believe that by controlling for some of these factors, including through the analysis of “doppelgangers”, we can see how misconduct correlates with various measures of career advancement. The central question we seek to explore is: *Do officers who frequently engage in misconduct get rewarded more than peers who offend less often?*

 For our research we will investigate the following questions. Scripts corresponding to each question can be found in each of the following files:

  - What proportion of officers get awards? (script1.sql)
  - What proportion of officers with 1+, 2+, 3+, etc. complaints get promoted each year? (script2.sql)
  - What proportion of officers with 1+, 2+, 3+, etc. complaints get awards? (script3.sql)
  - What proportion of officers with 1+, 2+, 3+, etc. sustained complaints get promoted each year? (script4.sql)
  - What proportion of officers with 1+, 2+, 3+, etc. sustained complaints get awards? (script5.sql)
